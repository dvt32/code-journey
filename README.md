# What is this repository about?

This repository is a collection of random programming problems and my solutions to them.

My early code is not very good, but I'm still leaving it as I originally wrote it, in order to track my own progress (I started programming in 2015).

Hopefully this will be helpful to someone. I will keep adding new problems and solutions, as I try out more programming languages and solve more challenges.
