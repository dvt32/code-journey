# What is this repository about?

This repository is a collection of random programming problems and my solutions to them. It also includes code that I've written for various programming courses, which I've taken over the years.

It is like a personal archive for documenting my journey as a software developer (I started in 2015). My early code is not very good, but I'm still leaving it as I originally wrote it, in order to track my own progress.

I will keep adding new problems and solutions, as I try out more programming languages and solve more challenges.
