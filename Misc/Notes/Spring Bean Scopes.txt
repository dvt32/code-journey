Spring Bean Scopes

There are FIVE (5) SCOPES!

1. SINGLETON 
- one instance per Spring container (default scope)
- if you autowire bean multiple times, same instance will be retrieved every time

2. PROTOTYPE 
- new instance every time bean is requested from the Spring container
- if you autowire bean multiple times, new instance will be retrieved every time

---

3. REQUEST - same as PROTOTYPE but for WEB APPLICATION (new instance every HTTP request)

4. SESSION - new instance for each HTTP session by the container

5. GLOBAL-SESSION - used to create global-session beans for Portlet applications
