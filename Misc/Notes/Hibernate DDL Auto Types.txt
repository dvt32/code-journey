Hibernate DDL Auto Types:
- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto.

The standard Hibernate property values are: create, update, create-drop, validate and none:

1) create 
– Hibernate first drops existing tables, then creates new tables

2) update 
- the object model created based on the mappings (annotations or XML) is compared with the existing schema, and then Hibernate updates the schema according to the diff. 
- It never deletes the existing tables or columns even if they are no more required by the application

3) create-drop 
- similar to create, with the addition that Hibernate will drop the database after all operations are completed. 
- Typically used for unit testing

4) validate 
– Hibernate only validates whether the tables and columns exist, otherwise it throws an exception

5) none 
– this value effectively turns off the DDL generation

Spring Boot internally defaults 
this parameter value to create-drop 
if no schema manager has been detected, 
otherwise none for all other cases.
