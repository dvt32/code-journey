Java exceptions

1. Checked (Compile-time)
- FileNotFoundException (because it MAY be not found, so you should prepare)
- SQLException (database access for example)

2. Unchecked (Runtime) -> program logic error
- Divide by zero
- Access index outside of array bounds
- Errors (beyond your control)
	- Out of memory

“If a client CAN reasonably be expected to RECOVER from an exception, make it a CHECKED exception. 

If a client CANNOT do anything to RECOVER from the exception, make it an UNCHECKED exception.”
