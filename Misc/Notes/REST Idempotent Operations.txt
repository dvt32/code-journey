Idempotent Operation
---

- A operation that can be done multiple times and THE RESULT (on the SYSTEM) is the same.
- Idempotent is about the EFFECT OF THE REQUEST (state of the SYSTEM), not about the HTTP response that you get (those can differ).

Idempontent  operations:
- GET (and TRACE, HEAD, OPTION)
- PUT
- DELETE

PUT is idempotent, because if we send the same update multiple times, it shouldn't change resource.

DELETE is idempotent, because first time resource is deleted, second time no side effects to system.

POST is NOT idempotent, because it creates a new resource every time (but it can be modified to be idempotent).

PATCH is NOT idempotent (but can also be modified to be idempontent). Here is an example why:
- we want to add item to shopping cart
- PUT = send whole shopping cart data, 
  PATCH = only add item to shopping cart
- if we send PATCH again, item will be added again and resource will have different state
