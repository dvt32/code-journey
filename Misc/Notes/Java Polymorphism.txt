Java Polymorphism

1. Static (Compile-time) Polymorphism
- Method Overloading

A obj = new A();
obj.add(1, 2);
obj.add(1, 2, 3); // methods with same name, different params, COMPILER says "ok, i have to call these 2 methods"


---

2. Dynamic (Runtime) Polymorphism
- Method Overriding

A obj = new B(); // B extends A
obj.doStuff(); // A & B have foo() method

-> At runtime JVM says "it's a B object and B overrides doStuff() so B.doStuff() will be called"
