@ElementCollection:
- the relation is managed (only) by the entity in which the relation is defined
- table contains id reference to the owning entity plus basic or embedded attributes

@OneToMany / @ManyToMany:
- can also be managed by the other entity
- join table or column(s) typically contains id references only
