1. What is NoSQL?
- Stands for "NOT ONLY SQL" or "No-relations SQL"
- A Non-Relational Database (No Tables)
- Used for BIG DATA & real-time web apps
- There are multiple TYPES of NoSQL databases

2. What is Big Data?
- Data sets SO LARGE that traditional ways for storage/processing are not suitable
- Massive increase in data volume within last decade
- Social networks, search engines etc
- Challenges in storage, capture, analysis, transfer, etc

3. NoSQL Advantages (over RDBMS)
- Handles Big Data
- Data Models - no predefined DB schema like RDMBS
- Data Structure - handles UNSTRUCTURED data
- CHEAPER to manage
- Has HORIZONTAL scaling (not bigger box, but MORE small boxes where data is divided)

4. RDBMS Advantages (over NoSQL)
- Better for relational data (connected data)
- Normalization
- Well known language (SQL)
- Data Integrity (constraints)
- ACID Compliance

5. Types of NoSQL Databases
- Document Databases (MongoDB, CouchDB) - like JSON, multiple docs with key-value pairs
- Column Databases (Apache Cassandra) - good for analytics
- Key-Value Stores (Redis, Couchbase Server) - simplest
- Cache Systems (Redis, Memcache)
- Graph Databases (Neo4j)
