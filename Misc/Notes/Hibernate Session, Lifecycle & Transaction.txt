- TRANSIENT object
	-> not saved in database
	-> not associated with Session (must be saved first)
- PERSISTENT object 
	-> object saved in database and tracked by Hibernate
	-> associated with Session (changes to data will be reflected in database)
	-> only until transaction is comitted & session is closed

	-> object WAS saved in database and WAS tracked by Hibernate
	-> NO LONGER associated with Session
