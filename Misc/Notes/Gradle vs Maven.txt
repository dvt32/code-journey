Gradle vs Maven
---

Gradle intended to avoid Maven drawbacks

Gradle:
- Uses DSL (domain-specific language) based on Groovy/Kotlin for project structure
- Less verbose build files
- Faster than Maven
- Avoids Java compilation
- Has "tasks"

Maven:
- Uses XML for project structure
- More verbose build files
- Slower than Gradle
- Necessary Java compilation
- Has "phases"
