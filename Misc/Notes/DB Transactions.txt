Transactions
- group of tasks

---

ACID:

1) Atomic
- either ALL tasks are executed, or NONE of them are executed
- no partial execution allowed

2) Consistent
- The data in DB cannot be changed in ways are that not allowed - with invalid DATA for example (if so, transaction is aborted and not executed)
- if DB was in consistent VALID state before transaction, it should be like that AFTER transaction (otherwise transaction is aborted)

3) Isolated
- no transaction will affect the existence of ANOTHER transaction (for example with multi-threading)

4) Durable
- If a transaction commits but the system fails before the data could be written on to the disk, then that data will be updated once the system springs back into action.
