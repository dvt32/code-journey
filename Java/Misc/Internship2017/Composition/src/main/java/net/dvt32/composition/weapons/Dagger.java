/**
 * This class represents a type of Weapon - a Dagger.
 * A dagger has one attribute â€“ damage. Each time the dagger is used, an 11-sided dice is thrown.  
 * - If the dice is greater than 6, it deals double damage. 
 * - If it is less than 6, it just deals full damage.
 * The Dagger is intended to be used by a Hero.
